                <h5 class="ti ajustify">From our discussion about the importance of studying the subject English for Academic and Professional Purpose to the Importance of Academic Writing as well as the characteristics of Academic Texts, I have learned a lot.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">I always ask myself this question, “Why study EAPP?” and that question was recently answered in our discussion. I learned that we should study EAPP for the reason that it helps us in so many ways both in written and oral communication. It helps us become a professional individual where we must learn how to write and speak formal languages.  Aside from that, I also learned new Language Skills. I already know The Four Basic Language Skills which is Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Now, I know about the Fluency Development that means to practice and develop my reading fluency. Oral Intelligibility, Grammar, and Vocabulary Development. In addition, I acquired a knowledge of Academic Study Skills like test taking and note taking skills, Academic Vocabulary Usage, Critical Reading and Writing, Comprehending Academic Lectures, Research and Library Skills, and lastly, Formal Composition Forms and Development. I admit I am not yet that good in this English skills but I am determined to improve. 
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">As our teacher stated, the subject English for Academic Professional Purpose includes Academic Texts, Academic Writing, Academic Reading, and Academic Language. The Importance of Academic Writing was what we first tackled. According to EAPFoundation.com, Academic writing is arguably the most important skill in academic contexts, since writing is the main method of academic communication and I agree. To me, the purpose of learning Academic writing is to help us improve our writing skills as well as to help us communicate ideas, information, and research to the wider academic community. I believe that it is also the most difficult skill for most students to master. Our teacher said that Academic writing is the style used in college and universities as it is formal. It is also used in writing resume´, which makes Academic writing even more important to learn. 
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">Other things I’ve learned are the characteristics of Academic texts. It involves making use of a formal rather than informal language, make texts evident, clear and precise facts or objects, simple rather than complex, lastly, objective rather than subjective. An example of this is “The improvements cannot be introduced due to funding restrictions.” To make it formal, it should be: “The improvements can’t be introduced due to funding restrictions.” Using the contraction ‘can’t’ is formal than using the word ‘cannot’.</h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify pbottom">From a 30-minute discussion, I have learned a lot and I am looking forward to our next meeting as I believe that I will acquire new knowledge again.</h5>
