                <h5 class="ti ajustify">Polar bears are amazing animals. Polar bears habitat is the sea ice so they rely almost entirely 
                    on the sea ice environment. Their life depends on the sea ice and to everything that swims, paddles 
                    beneath their paws. They feed on seals as the seals are the only food source of high-fat content and 
                    calories to keep them healthy but will feed on whale carcasses when needed. </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">
                    An article by Stephen Leahy entitled “Polar Bears Really are Starving Because of Global 
    Warming Study Shows”, published on February 2018 was inspired by a photo of a polar bear. The 
photo was shot by Paul Nicklen and Cristina Mittermeier and was published on National Geographic 
in early December. The photo shows skinny polar bear sitting on iceless land waiting for a seal to 
appear. This writer was also moved by the photos. Her concern to animal’s plight, particularly the 
polar bears, was awakened. 
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">
                    Polar bears lives are in danger and at risk due to global warming. 
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">Polar bears inhabit the huge Arctic Region’s sea ice which is larger than Alaska and California 
                    combined. Studies shows that climate change is heating up the place thus making the sea ice melt. 
                    This is alarming as polar bears lives will be in danger. They are not used to humid weather and they 
                    are bound to burn huge amount of energy when it is warm. 
                     </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">The melting sea ice has great effect on the lives of the polar bears, their lives will be in danger 
                    and at risk. They are threatened to get hungry as their lives depend on seals. It will be hard for them 
                    to hunt seals. If they get hungry, the polar bears will be forced to look for food to survive. This is 
                    disturbing because if they cannot hunt in the sea, they will soon starve. They will walk to look for 
                    food, sadly, the polar bears are not built for walking, they are swimmers so walking will burn their 
                    stored energy which will cause them to even more get unhealthy. Their lives will be in danger. </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">While reading the article and seeing the pictures shot by Paul Nicklen and Cristina 
                    Mittermeier published on National Geographic in early December, awakened this writer’s concern 
                    on what is happening in her environment. Global warming and climate change does not only put the 
                    lives of polar bears at risks but also the whole mankind. Fear of what will happen in the future comes 
                    to her mind. What can she do to help address the problem on global warming? </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify pbottom">Therefore, this writer strongly believes that polar bears lives are in danger and at risks due 
                    to the impact of global warming.</h5>
