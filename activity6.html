        <div class="row"> 
            <div class="twelve columns">
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">My interest was awakened by the short story when I read its first part. I decided to read it till the end because I wanted to know the “would be” decision of the lead male character. The lead male character, Alfredo Salazar, is a lawyer who is engage to be married to Esperanza. He is torn between two lovers. Alfredo is in a situation of love at the wrong time or a forbidden love when he met and got attracted to Julia.  </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">
                    As I go through the short story, I am getting angry and disgusted with Alfredo because of his betrayal, unfaithfulness, and disloyalty to Esperanza. On the other hand, I felt empathy to Esperanza and Julia. I am disgusted that the two women are victims of Alfredo’s deception.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">
                    Every now and then, I encountered many unfamiliar words, the meaning of which I don’t know, so I had to look up the meaning from the Wikipedia. Even then, I was determined to finish my reading as I was curious to know how the story would end and why the title of the story is Dead Stars.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">Dead stars in science is a star that has exhausted all the fuel from nuclear fusion and is simply the core of the former star floating through the space, thus, it shines no more. For me, it symbolizes the love that is not realized or fulfilled. It just faded away and eventually forgotten because it is never meant to be.
                     </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">I learned that in the olden days, conscience and morality are important especially when fidelity, faithfulness, and loyalty between lovers are in question. A man who is not yet married has the free will to choose who he loves but when he is engaged to be married, he should consider the feelings of the women he will deceive and betray. </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">There are so many Alfredos’ nowadays who get caught between two lovers but very few makes the decision as Alfredo did. At present, married men who gets attracted to other women become a common family story. I can see and hear stories of this kind. Heaven forbids, but in case I get to meet a kind of men like Alfredo, I would choose to become like Esperanza and Julia. Like Esperanza, I will be strong-willed and let go of the man should I discover his infidelity, disloyalty, unfaithfulness and deception. I know it will hurt me but I will not let him hurt me and make me unhappy for the rest of my life. On the other hand, if ever I am placed on the shoes of Julia and become the object of attraction of a man who is already in a relationship, still, I will exercise my will power and make my morals and conscience rule over me. I will turn him down, notwithstanding how I feel for him, because I pity the woman he betrays. Besides, I know he is deceiving not only the person he is committed with but also me. </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify pbottom">The short story taught me how to very careful before trusting anybody. It taught me that I should learn to control my emotion and get to know very well the person I will trust. I have learned that in everything that I do and decide, I should always consider the morality in my decision and how my conscience will take it. I learned that fidelity and loyalty to persons important in my life should not be taken for granted. It will define the kind of person I am.</h5>

                <h5 class="ajustify">The article entitled “Extreme weather-not politicians-convinces Americans the climate change is real”, was written by Mark Kaufman in the Mashable and was published on January 22, 2019. </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">The survey aimed to know what drives the views of the Americans that convince them the climate change is really happening. The survey method used in the survey was random sampling. Over 1,200 adult Americans were randomly selected from every state in the U.S.  Answers were gathered over the phone or via the web. The survey included how the political leader’s views on climate change influence their answers.</h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">
                    The result of the survey shows that 7 out of 10 Americans believe that climate change is happening. Of the total respondents, 48 percent found today’s climate science is more convincing, 36 percent said their views have not changed and 16 percent said that the climate science is less convincing.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">
                    Based on the evidences, human activities like emissions of greenhouse gases greatly affects the climate. Almost half of the Americans are convinced that ¾ of them attributed their changing views to the U.S experienced record breaking heat, record breaking flooding, and record breaking wildfires. Of the question if the political leaders use influence on the Americans views regarding climate change, 18 percent of those surveyed responded the views of the political leaders were an influential factor.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">Overall, 71 percent of the Americans today believe that climate change is happening.	
                     </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">The article awakens awareness to the effects of extreme climate change in the population of an advanced and modern country like U.S. The author clearly showed that most Americans admit that what is happening to their country, particularly the extreme climate change is partly their own activities. It clearly showed that the Americans are recognizing the ill effects and are doing measures to support environment restoration and renewable energy R & D as reported by the University of Chicago. It is good the article included how the political leader’s views influence their respondent’s views. It showed that most Americans view on climate change and how it affects the country is not influenced by power and political party they are attached to.  </h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify">The article is a complete report as it also cited the U.S governments scientists recent report that the “U.S government atmospheric, marine, and earth scientists have little doubt that the climate is experiencing profound change in human activity is the dominant cause.” This will create a shadow of doubt to the views of the Americans. Moreover, the article clearly showed that the results of the recent (November 18, 2018) survey clearly support the results of the similar poll in 2017 from the same research organization.</h5>
                <h5 class="ti ajustify pbottom">Overall, the article gave a clear information about the result of the poll survey that the extreme weather convinces the Americans that climate change is real and not the influence of the views of powerful politicians. The Americans admit that human activities contribute too much to the change in climate and agrees to help resolve the problem.</h5>
