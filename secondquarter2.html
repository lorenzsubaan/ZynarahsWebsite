                <h5>The debate that happened last Friday was very different from what I experienced in Junior High School. I was once a participant in a debate when I was in high school, however, in the recent debate, I was a member of the Committee. It was my second debate experience and I must admit that the debate this time was more fun and intense.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="ti ajustify">
                <h5>From the very beginning of the program, I was feeling nervous, happy, excited, all kinds of mixed emotions. As I was one of the members of the Committee, the ones responsible for the planning and conducting of the program, I was hoping that the program would be carried out properly and successfully. Throughout the whole program, I was all smiles as I felt the same rush and emotions of the debaters. It was interesting hearing their arguments. We, the Committee members, were the ones who prepared the questions that they would answer impromptu and hearing them answer the questions and stating their arguments for their stand made me feel even more excited and nervous. I felt like I was one of the participants and wanted to state my arguments, too.</h5>

                <h5>
                    The Committee was aware that the debate might get too intense so we prepared an ice breaker at the end of each debate. The ice breaker for the first debate was a surprise number from my classmate wherein she sang a lovely song that helped calm the mood as well as the participants.  The second ice breaker presented after the second debate was the advertisement video of Jackie Chan for Shopee. The ice breakers were something new to me as in my first experience, we didn’t have of its kind. There were some points in the program where the second debate got too intense and led the two teams to slightly deviate from the debate and had mild personal attacks toward each other, which the Committee, was unable to prevent. So, the Shopee advertisement video presented really helped in breaking the ice between the two groups. I was laughing while the Shopee advertisement video was playing and eventually I too calmed down.

                <h5>
                    As a member of the Committee, I was given the task to document the program together with two other members. During the whole event, I was taking notes of the flow of the program as well as the arguments of each teams. It was my first time to document a debate. I devoted a lot of time on doing the documentation which was worth it as I am sure I did a pretty good job on my part. 
                </h5>

                <h5>
                    Overall, it was an amazing and unforgettable learning experience. The activity was one experience that made every one of us prove to ourselves that we can be able to talk and express ideas and thoughts impromptu. I am glad that I was able to experience and took part in this debate activity. Although this time, it was held through an online platform as face to face classes are still not permitted, still, I was able to have a fun time and I’m sure my classmates also felt the same. We were offered a unique debate experience because it was conducted through the new normal platform of classes, more so, because of the intensity of the battle. I am grateful to our EAPP teacher, Ms. Donna Montalban for letting us experience an enjoyable and educational debate. I look forward to another debate program.
